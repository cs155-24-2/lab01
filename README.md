# CS 155 24.2 Lab 01

## Instructions

1. Lab 01 specs are attached in github classroom.

2. As shown last week, you may clone the flex repository in https://github.com/westes/flex.git.

3. **Important:** Whenever you do a `git add` to incorporate your changes, make sure to use: 

```
git add --chmod=+x .
``` 

This way, the custom github autocorrect has permissions to execute your file.

4. **Also Important:** Lab 01 asks you to write three versions, the third of which is a bonus. Please make sure to upload **both** the **.lex** and **.out** files for each version according to the following filenames:

```
v1.lex
v1.out
v2.lex
v2.out
v3.lex
v3.out
```

5. As usual, you only need to upload the files mentioned in (4). No need to push the whole flex repository.
